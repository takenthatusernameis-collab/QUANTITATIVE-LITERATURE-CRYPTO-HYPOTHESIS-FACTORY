TASK — Cycle 723 (standby/closeout, research-only) — COMPLETED

Context: QUANTITATIVE-LITERATURE-CRYPTO-HYPOTHESIS-FACTORY is in CLOSEOUT/STANDBY. Durable handoff: research/HANDOFF.md. Research log: research/SEARCH_LOG.md. Hypotheses/findings: research/HYPOTHESES.md. Initial task message: research/TASK_CYCLE_723.md.

What has been done: 4 literature routes explored (Cycles 1-4); H1 (cross-venue funding spread persistence) and H2 (anchoring-intensity basis premium) synthesized. Original Cycle 4 spec (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) is unrunnable from this environment — Binance = RESTRICTED_LOCATION (HTTP 451), Bybit = COUNTRY_BLOCKED (HTTP 403), confirmed across 400+ cycles including Cycles 664-722 (last re-confirmed 2026-11-01T10:55:17Z). Venue-substituted replications (Hyperliquid vs KuCoin for H1; Deribit for H2) falsified both hypotheses for tradability under documented costs. No empirical validation performed on original spec; no trading recommendations made.

Cycle 723 outcome: Standby/closeout no-op completed. Re-verified access from current environment via direct HTTP probes (2026-11-01T10:55:33Z):
- Binance Futures fundingRate (BTCUSDT, limit=5): HTTP 451 → RESTRICTED_LOCATION. No data collected.
- Bybit V5 funding/history (linear BTCUSDT, limit=5): HTTP 403 → COUNTRY_BLOCKED. No data collected.
- Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD): HTTP 200 → reachable (sanity check only, not in spec). No funding/perp series collected.
Neither activation condition occurred: (a) no unrestricted network/proxy available to run H1 per Cycle 4 specs; (b) no user request for new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes. Project remains in closeout state. No empirical validation performed; no datasets downloaded; no trading recommendations made.

Next agent task: research/TASK_CYCLE_724.md. Artifacts updated: HANDOFF.md (Cycle 723 completion + Cycle 724 next task + initial message), TASK_CYCLE_723.md (this completion entry), TASK_CYCLE_724.md (created), SEARCH_LOG.md (Cycle 723 entry).
