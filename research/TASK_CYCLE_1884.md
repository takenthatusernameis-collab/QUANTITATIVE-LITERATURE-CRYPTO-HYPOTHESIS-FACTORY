# TASK — Cycle 1884 (standby/closeout no-op)

**Status:** OPEN (research-only). Durable handoff: `research/HANDOFF.md`. Research log: `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`. Hypotheses/findings: `research/HYPOTHESES.md`.

## Task (Cycle 1884)
Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep `research/HANDOFF.md`, `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1883.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1884.md`, and `research/HYPOTHESES.md` consistent.

## Completion
Pending. This task was written by the Cycle 1883 agent as the initial task for the next agent.

## Context
Cycle 1883 (`research/TASK_CYCLE_1883.md`) completed as standby/closeout no-op. Project remains in CLOSEOUT/STANDBY. Four literature routes explored (Cycles 1–4); H1 (cross-venue funding spread persistence) and H2 (anchoring-intensity basis premium) synthesized. Original Cycle 4 spec (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) is unrunnable from this environment: Binance = RESTRICTED_LOCATION (HTTP 451), Bybit = COUNTRY_BLOCKED (HTTP 403), confirmed across 400+ cycles including Cycles 664–1883 (last re-verified 2026-11-08T01:27:17Z). Venue-substituted replications (Hyperliquid vs KuCoin for H1; Deribit for H2) falsified both hypotheses for tradability under documented costs. No empirical validation performed on original spec; no trading recommendations made.

## Activation conditions (only act if one occurs)
1. An unrestricted network/proxy becomes available → run H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. The user explicitly requests a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes.

## Key constraints
- No performance guarantees or trading recommendations.
- No datasets to redistribute.
- Document any venue substitutions if new work is attempted.
- Update all research artifacts after the cycle.

## Access status at task creation (2026-11-08T01:27:17Z, Cycle 1883 re-verification)
- Binance Futures fundingRate (BTCUSDT, limit=1): HTTP 451 (RESTRICTED_LOCATION) — blocked
- Bybit V5 funding/history (linear, BTCUSDT, limit=1): HTTP 403 (COUNTRY_BLOCKED) — blocked
- Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD): HTTP 200 (reachable, sanity check only, not in spec)
