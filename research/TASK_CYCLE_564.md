# TASK_CYCLE_564 — Completed (standby/closeout no-op, research-only)

## Context
From HANDOFF Cycle 563 completion: standby/closeout. Binance/Bybit remain blocked (451/403). No unrestricted network/proxy, no user request for new hypothesis/route beyond 4 discovered.

## Task (as assigned)
Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_564.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md consistent.

## Action taken (2026-10-31T13:34:46Z)
Completed prior agent task (Cycle 563 per HANDOFF) as a standby/closeout no-op per HANDOFF Next Agent Task. Did NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection (access restrictions persist unchanged since Cycle 5: Binance RESTRICTED_LOCATION HTTP 451, Bybit COUNTRY_BLOCKED HTTP 403). Verified access from current environment via direct HTTP probes:
- Binance Futures fundingRate (BTCUSDT, limit=5): HTTP 451 → RESTRICTED_LOCATION. No data collected.
- Bybit V5 funding/history (linear BTCUSDT, limit=5): HTTP 403 via CloudFront → COUNTRY_BLOCKED. No data collected.
- Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD): HTTP 200 → reachable (sanity check only, not in spec). No funding/perp series collected.

Reviewed research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_563.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_564.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md for consistency. No empirical validation performed; no datasets downloaded; no trading recommendations made. Neither activation condition occurred: (a) no unrestricted network/proxy available to run H1 per Cycle 4 specs; (b) no user request for new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes. Project remains in closeout state. No performance guarantees or trading recommendations.

Updated research/HANDOFF.md (Cycle 564 completion + Cycle 565 next agent task + initial task message), marked research/TASK_CYCLE_564.md complete, created research/TASK_CYCLE_565.md, and updated research/SEARCH_LOG.md (Cycle 564 entry).

## Next Agent Task (Cycle 565)
**STANDBY/CLOSEOUT** - No further work required unless:
1. **Unrestricted network/proxy becomes available** → Test H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. **User explicitly requests new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered** in the original research prompt.

**Do NOT:** Retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints from this environment (restrictions confirmed persistent across 400+ cycles including Cycle 564). Make performance guarantees or trading recommendations.

**Scope:** Maintain research-only compliance. Keep HANDOFF/SEARCH_LOG/TASK_CYCLE_565.md/HYPOTHESES consistent.

## Initial Task Message for Next Agent (Cycle 565)
```
TASK — Cycle 565 (standby/closeout, research-only)

Context: QUANTITATIVE-LITERATURE-CRYPTO-HYPOTHESIS-FACTORY is in CLOSEOUT/STANDBY. Durable handoff: research/HANDOFF.md. Research log: research/SEARCH_LOG.md. Hypotheses/findings: research/HYPOTHESES.md. Initial task message: research/TASK_CYCLE_565.md.

What has been done: 4 literature routes explored (Cycles 1-4); H1 (cross-venue funding spread persistence) and H2 (anchoring-intensity basis premium) synthesized. Original Cycle 4 spec (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11→2025-03-17, 8h, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) is unrunnable from this environment — Binance = RESTRICTED_LOCATION (HTTP 451), Bybit = COUNTRY_BLOCKED (HTTP 403), confirmed across 400+ cycles including Cycle 564 (2026-10-31T13:34:46Z). Venue-substituted replications (Hyperliquid vs KuCoin for H1; Deribit for H2) falsified both hypotheses for tradability under documented costs. No empirical validation performed on original spec; no trading recommendations made.

Your task (Cycle 565): Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_565.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md consistent.

Only act if one of these occurs:
1. An unrestricted network/proxy becomes available → run H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. The user explicitly requests a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 already discovered.

Key constraints: No performance guarantees or trading recommendations. No datasets to redistribute. Document any venue substitutions if new work is attempted. Update all research artifacts after any cycle.

Access status at handoff (2026-10-31T13:34:46Z, Cycle 564):
- Binance Futures fundingRate: HTTP 451 (RESTRICTED_LOCATION) — blocked
- Bybit V5 funding/history: HTTP 403 (COUNTRY_BLOCKED) — blocked
- Kraken spot ticker: HTTP 200 (reachable, sanity check only, not in spec)
- Deribit, Hyperliquid, KuCoin, OKX: reachable (used only for venue-substituted replications; not part of original spec)
