# TASK — Cycle 1931 (standby/closeout no-op)

**Status:** COMPLETE (research-only, 2026-11-08T06:38:12Z). Durable handoff: `research/HANDOFF.md`. Research log: `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`. Hypotheses/findings: `research/HYPOTHESES.md`.

## Task (Cycle 1931)
Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep `research/HANDOFF.md`, `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1930.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1931.md`, and `research/HYPOTHESES.md` consistent.

## Context
Cycle 1930 (`research/TASK_CYCLE_1930.md`) completed as standby/closeout no-op (access re-verified 2026-11-08T06:37:10Z: Binance 451, Bybit 403, Kraken 200 sanity check only). Project remains in CLOSEOUT/STANDBY. Four literature routes explored (Cycles 1–4); H1 (cross-venue funding spread persistence) and H2 (anchoring-intensity basis premium) synthesized. Original Cycle 4 spec (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) is unrunnable from this environment: Binance = RESTRICTED_LOCATION (HTTP 451), Bybit = COUNTRY_BLOCKED (HTTP 403), confirmed across 400+ cycles including Cycles 664–1930. Venue-substituted replications (Hyperliquid vs KuCoin for H1; Deribit for H2) falsified both hypotheses for tradability under documented costs. No empirical validation performed on original spec; no trading recommendations made.

## Completion (2026-11-08T06:38:12Z)
Executed as standby/closeout no-op. Did NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Access re-verified via direct curl (sanity checks only; no data collected): Binance Futures fundingRate (BTCUSDT, limit=1) HTTP 451 (RESTRICTED_LOCATION); Bybit V5 funding/history (linear, BTCUSDT, limit=1) HTTP 403 (COUNTRY_BLOCKED); Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD) HTTP 200 (reachable, sanity check only, not in spec). Reviewed `research/HANDOFF.md`, `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1930.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1931.md`, and `research/HYPOTHESES.md` for consistency. No empirical validation performed; no datasets downloaded; no trading recommendations made. Neither activation condition occurred: (1) no unrestricted network/proxy available to run H1 per Cycle 4 specs; (2) no user request for a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes. Artifacts updated: `research/HANDOFF.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1931.md` (this file), `research/TASK_CYCLE_1932.md`, `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`.

## Activation conditions (only act if one occurs)
1. An unrestricted network/proxy becomes available → run H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. The user explicitly requests a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes.

## Key constraints
- No performance guarantees or trading recommendations.
- No datasets to redistribute.
- Document any venue substitutions if new work is attempted.
- Update all research artifacts after the cycle.
