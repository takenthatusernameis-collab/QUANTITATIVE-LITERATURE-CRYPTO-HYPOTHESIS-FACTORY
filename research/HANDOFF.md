# DURABLE HANDOFF (Cycle 202)

## Status
Project is in **CLOSEOUT/STANDBY** state. All prior cycles (1-194) completed as documented in HANDOFF.md and SEARCH_LOG.md. No empirical validation performed on original Binance/Bybit spec due to persistent access restrictions.

## Current Environment Access (Verified 2026-10-26T18:09:40Z, Cycle 195)
- **Binance Futures** `fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/fundingRate?symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=5`: HTTP 451 → **RESTRICTED_LOCATION** (eligibility restriction)
- **Bybit V5** `api.bybit.com/v5/market/funding/history?category=linear&symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=5`: HTTP 403 via CloudFront → **COUNTRY_BLOCKED**
- **Kraken spot** `api.kraken.com/0/public/Ticker?pair=XBTUSD`: HTTP 200 (sanity check only, not in Cycle 4 spec)

## Key Findings (Venue-Substituted Replications)
- **H1 (cross-venue funding spread persistence, Binance−Bybit):** Tested Hyperliquid vs KuCoin (2025-06-17–2025-10-14, 359 obs). Directional accuracy 0.850 on test but mean |ΔF|=1.24e-4 vs roundtrip costs ≥0.07% (taker-mix); fee-aware falsification met. Statistical persistence exists but not tradable under published fees.
- **H2 (basis mean-reversion/funding scaling):** Tested Deribit (BTC-settled/inverse, index_price as spot proxy, interest_8h funding). AR(1) mean reversion unstable OOS (train β positive hl~0.15, test β negative), |funding| correlation with next basis change negligible (-0.004), deviations small vs rt costs (~7e-4). Falsified under costs.

## Cycle 195 — Completed (standby/closeout no-op, research-only) [2026-10-26T18:09:40Z]
Action: Completed prior agent task (Cycle 195) as a standby/closeout no-op per HANDOFF Next agent task. Did NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Verified access from current environment via direct HTTP probes:
- Binance Futures fundingRate (BTCUSDT, limit=5): HTTP 451 = RESTRICTED_LOCATION (eligibility restriction). No data collected.
- Bybit V5 funding/history (linear BTCUSDT, limit=5): HTTP 403 via CloudFront = COUNTRY_BLOCKED. No data collected.
- Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD): HTTP 200 = reachable (sanity check only, not in Cycle 4 spec). No funding/perp series collected.
Outcome: Access restrictions persist unchanged since Cycle 5. Neither activation condition occurred: (a) no unrestricted network/proxy available to run H1 per Cycle 4 specs; (b) no user request for new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes.

## Next Agent Task (Cycle 206)
**STANDBY/CLOSEOUT** - No further work required unless:
1. **Unrestricted network/proxy becomes available** → Test H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. **User explicitly requests new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered** in the original research prompt.

**Do NOT:** Retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints from this environment (restrictions confirmed persistent across 190+ cycles including Cycle 205). Make performance guarantees or trading recommendations.

**Scope:** Maintain research-only compliance. Keep HANDOFF/SEARCH_LOG/HYPOTHESES consistent.

## Initial Task Message for Next Agent (Cycle 206)
```
TASK — Cycle 206 (standby/closeout, research-only)

Context: QUANTITATIVE-LITERATURE-CRYPTO-HYPOTHESIS-FACTORY is in CLOSEOUT/STANDBY. Durable handoff: research/HANDOFF.md. Research log: research/SEARCH_LOG.md. Hypotheses/findings: research/HYPOTHESES.md.

What has been done: 4 literature routes explored (Cycles 1-4); H1 (cross-venue funding spread persistence) and H2 (anchoring-intensity basis premium) synthesized. Original Cycle 4 spec (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11→2025-03-17, 8h, OOS ≥4 months) is unrunnable from this environment — Binance = RESTRICTED_LOCATION (HTTP 451), Bybit = COUNTRY_BLOCKED (HTTP 403), confirmed across 190+ cycles including Cycle 205 (2026-10-26T19:09:56Z). Venue-substituted replications (Hyperliquid vs KuCoin for H1; Deribit for H2) falsified both hypotheses for tradability under documented costs. No empirical validation performed on original spec; no trading recommendations made.

Your task (Cycle 206): Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md consistent.

Only act if one of these occurs:
1. An unrestricted network/proxy becomes available → run H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. The user explicitly requests a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 already discovered.

Key constraints: No performance guarantees or trading recommendations. No datasets to redistribute. Document any venue substitutions if new work is attempted. Update all three research artifacts after any cycle.

Access status at handoff (2026-10-26T19:09:56Z, Cycle 205):
- Binance Futures fundingRate: HTTP 451 (RESTRICTED_LOCATION) — blocked
- Bybit V5 funding/history: HTTP 403 (COUNTRY_BLOCKED) — blocked
- Kraken spot ticker: HTTP 200 (reachable, sanity check only, not in spec)
- Deribit, Hyperliquid, KuCoin, OKX: reachable (used only for venue-substituted replications; not part of original spec)
```
