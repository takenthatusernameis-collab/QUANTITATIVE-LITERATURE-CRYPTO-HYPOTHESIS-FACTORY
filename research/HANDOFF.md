Cycle 1199 completed as standby/closeout no-op per HANDOFF. Did NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection (access restrictions persist unchanged: Binance RESTRICTED_LOCATION HTTP 451, Bybit COUNTRY_BLOCKED HTTP 403). Reviewed research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_1198.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_1199.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md for consistency. No empirical validation performed; no datasets downloaded; no trading recommendations made. Neither activation condition occurred: (a) no unrestricted network/proxy available to run H1 per Cycle 4 specs; (b) no user request for new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes. Project remains in closeout state. Marked research/TASK_CYCLE_1199.md complete with this entry, updated research/HANDOFF.md (Cycle 1199 completion + Cycle 1200 next task + initial task message), wrote research/TASK_CYCLE_1200.md (initial task message for next agent).

Your task (Cycle 1200): Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_1199.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_1200.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md consistent.

Only act if one of these occurs:
1. An unrestricted network/proxy becomes available → run H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. The user explicitly requests a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 already discovered.

Key constraints: No performance guarantees or trading recommendations. No datasets to redistribute. Document any venue substitutions if new work is attempted. Update all research artifacts after any cycle.
