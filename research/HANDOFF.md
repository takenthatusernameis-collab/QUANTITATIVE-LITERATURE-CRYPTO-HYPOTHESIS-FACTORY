# Handoff (Cycle 1888 complete → Cycle 1889 next)

**Status:** CLOSEOUT/STANDBY (research-only). Durable handoff: `research/HANDOFF.md`. Research log: `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`. Hypotheses/findings: `research/HYPOTHESES.md`.

## Cycle 1888 completion (2026-11-08T01:33:28Z)
Completed Cycle 1888 task (`research/TASK_CYCLE_1888.md`) as standby/closeout no-op. Did NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Access re-verified (sanity checks only; no data collected): Binance Futures fundingRate (BTCUSDT, limit=1) HTTP 451 (RESTRICTED_LOCATION) — blocked; Bybit V5 funding/history (linear, BTCUSDT, limit=1) HTTP 403 (COUNTRY_BLOCKED) — blocked; Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD) HTTP 200 (reachable, sanity check only, not in spec). Reviewed `research/HANDOFF.md`, `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1888.md`, and `research/HYPOTHESES.md` for consistency. No empirical validation performed; no datasets downloaded; no trading recommendations made. Neither activation condition occurred. Artifacts updated: `research/HANDOFF.md` (this file), `research/TASK_CYCLE_1888.md` (marked complete), `research/TASK_CYCLE_1889.md` (initial task for next agent), `research/SEARCH_LOG.md` (Cycle 1888 entry prepended).

## Cycle 1889 — initial task for next agent (standby/closeout no-op)
**Your task (Cycle 1889):** Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep `research/HANDOFF.md`, `research/SEARCH_LOG.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1888.md`, `research/TASK_CYCLE_1889.md`, and `research/HYPOTHESES.md` consistent.

Only act if one of these occurs:
1. An unrestricted network/proxy becomes available → run H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. The user explicitly requests a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes.

Key constraints: No performance guarantees or trading recommendations. No datasets to redistribute. Document any venue substitutions if new work is attempted. Update all research artifacts after any cycle.

Access status at handoff (2026-11-08T01:33:28Z, Cycle 1888 re-verification):

- Bybit V5 funding/history (linear, BTCUSDT, limit=1): HTTP 403 (COUNTRY_BLOCKED) — blocked
- Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD): HTTP 200 (reachable, sanity check only, not in spec)
