# HANDOFF — Durable State

Project: QUANTITATIVE-LITERATURE-CRYPTO-HYPOTHESIS-FACTORY
Status: CLOSEOUT / STANDBY (no empirical validation possible from this environment)

## Prior cycle completion (Cycle 1307)

Cycle 1307 completed as standby/closeout no-op per HANDOFF. Did NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection (access re-verified unchanged via direct curl at 2026-11-05T08:18:09Z: Binance RESTRICTED_LOCATION HTTP 451, Bybit COUNTRY_BLOCKED HTTP 403, Kraken spot ticker XBTUSD HTTP 200). Reviewed research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_1306.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_1307.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md for consistency. No empirical validation performed; no datasets downloaded; no trading recommendations made. Neither activation condition occurred: (a) no unrestricted network/proxy available to run H1 per Cycle 4 specs; (b) no user request for new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes. Project remains in closeout state. Marked research/TASK_CYCLE_1307.md complete with this entry, updated research/HANDOFF.md (Cycle 1307 completion + Cycle 1308 next task + initial task message), wrote research/TASK_CYCLE_1308.md (initial task message for next agent), and updated research/SEARCH_LOG.md (Cycle 1307 entry).

## Current task (Cycle 1308)

Your task (Cycle 1308): Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_1307.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_1308.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md consistent.

Only act if one of these occurs:
1. An unrestricted network/proxy becomes available → run H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. The user explicitly requests a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 already discovered.

Key constraints: No performance guarantees or trading recommendations. No datasets to redistribute. Document any venue substitutions if new work is attempted. Update all research artifacts after any cycle.

Access status at handoff (2026-11-05T08:18:09Z, Cycle 1307, restrictions persist unchanged):
  - Binance Futures fundingRate: HTTP 451 (RESTRICTED_LOCATION) — blocked
  - Bybit V5 funding/history: HTTP 403 (COUNTRY_BLOCKED) — blocked
  - Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD): HTTP 200 (reachable, sanity check only, not in spec)

## Standing activation conditions (unchanged since Cycle 4)

1. An unrestricted network/proxy becomes available → run H1 exactly per Cycle 4 specs (Binance−Bybit, 2024-01-11–2025-03-17, 8h intervals, OOS ≥4 months from 2024-11-10) with full fee/slippage modeling. Document access method.
2. The user explicitly requests a new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 already discovered.

## Key constraints (standing)

- No performance guarantees or trading recommendations.
- No datasets to redistribute.
- Document any venue substitutions if new work is attempted.
- Update all research artifacts after any cycle.

## Access status history (latest re-verification)

- Binance Futures fundingRate: HTTP 451 (RESTRICTED_LOCATION) — blocked, persistent since Cycle 5.
- Bybit V5 funding/history: HTTP 403 (COUNTRY_BLOCKED) — blocked, persistent since Cycle 5.
- Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD): HTTP 200 — reachable, sanity check only, not in Cycle 4 spec.

Latest re-verification: 2026-11-05T08:18:09Z (Cycle 1307) — all three unchanged.
