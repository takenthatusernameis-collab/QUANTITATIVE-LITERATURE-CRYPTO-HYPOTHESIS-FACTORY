# TASK_CYCLE_587.md — Cycle 587 (standby/closeout, research-only)

## Prior Agent Task (Cycle 586 per HANDOFF)
Standby/closeout no-op. Do NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection. Maintain research-only scope. Keep research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_586.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_587.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md consistent.

## Completion (Cycle 587) — 2026-10-31T16:48:XXZ
Action: Completed prior agent task (Cycle 586 per HANDOFF) as a standby/closeout no-op per HANDOFF Next Agent Task. Did NOT retry blocked Binance/Bybit endpoints for data collection (access restrictions persist unchanged since Cycle 5: Binance RESTRICTED_LOCATION HTTP 451, Bybit COUNTRY_BLOCKED HTTP 403). Verified access from current environment via direct HTTP probes:
- Binance Futures fundingRate (BTCUSDT, limit=5): HTTP 451 → RESTRICTED_LOCATION. No data collected.
- Bybit V5 funding/history (linear BTCUSDT, limit=5): HTTP 403 via CloudFront → COUNTRY_BLOCKED. No data collected.
- Kraken spot ticker (XBTUSD): HTTP 200 → reachable (sanity check only, not in spec). No funding/perp series collected.
Reviewed research/HANDOFF.md, research/SEARCH_LOG.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_586.md, research/TASK_CYCLE_587.md, and research/HYPOTHESES.md for consistency. No empirical validation performed; no datasets downloaded; no trading recommendations made. Neither activation condition occurred: (a) no unrestricted network/proxy available to run H1 per Cycle 4 specs; (b) no user request for new hypothesis/route beyond the 4 discovered routes. Project remains in closeout state. No performance guarantees or trading recommendations. Artifacts updated for Cycle 587 completion and Cycle 588 next task.
